# Hash Tables

This project explores the concept of hash tables, a data structure that provides efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. The project focuses on understanding hash functions, collision handling, and the advantages and use cases of hash tables.

## Resources

To enhance your understanding of hash tables, you may find the following resources helpful:

- [What is a HashTable Data Structure - Introduction to Hash Tables, Part 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0)
- [Hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
- [Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)
- [All about hash tables](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/hash-map)
- [Why hash tables and not arrays](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40561282/why-hash-tables-and-not-arrays)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without relying on external resources:

- What a hash function is and what makes a good hash function
- How hash tables work and how to use them effectively
- Collision handling methods in the context of hash tables
- The advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
- Common use cases where hash tables are beneficial

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a newline character
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Usage of global variables is not allowed
- Each function should have no more than 5 functions
- You are allowed to use the C standard library
- The prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `hash_tables.h`
- The header files should have include guards

## Project Structure

This project includes the implementation of hash tables in the C programming language. It provides functions for creating a hash table, inserting key-value pairs, and retrieving values based on keys. The code follows the guidelines specified in the requirements and adheres to the Betty coding style.

To test the implementation, a set of tests is strongly encouraged. Collaborate with your peers to create comprehensive tests that cover various scenarios and edge cases.

## Python Dictionaries

Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of the underlying mechanics behind Python dictionaries. The simplicity and power of dictionaries will become more apparent. It's worth noting that Python uses a slightly different implementation compared to the one covered in this project. If you're curious about the internal workings of Python dictionaries, you can explore this [blog post](https://rushter.com/blog/python-dictionary-implementation/) that provides insights into how dictionaries are implemented in Python 2.7 (not mandatory).

Please note that not all dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, and there are differences between dictionaries and hash tables. You can read more about the topic to further expand your knowledge (not mandatory).

Remember that plagiarism is strictly forbidden. Avoid copying and pasting code. Instead, focus on understanding the concepts and implementing your own solutions to meet the project's learning objectives.
